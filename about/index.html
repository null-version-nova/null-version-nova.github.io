        We are a plural system of 5, consisting of Elizabeth Theodora, November Absentia, Lucy Morningstar, Indigo
        Jay, and Fleur Dianthus. Collectively though, we are the Many-Named Angel. Refer to us by any of the five
        constituents, or by our collective name.

        Lizzy, Jay, and Dia all use she/her and it/its. Lucy just uses she/her, and Nova just uses it/its.
        Collectively, she or it both work :)
